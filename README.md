# JS Project Proposal: Ecto-Drum
Ecto-Drum is a web-based drum machine that allows users to create custom beats and download them as .wav files.  
[Here is an example of the concept] (http://www.html5drummachine.com/)

## Functionality & MVP
With Ecto-Drum, users will be able to:
* Start and stop audio
* Create custom rhythms with a simple user interface
* Record and download audio
* Add audio effects to their beats  

This project will also include:
* A production README
* Links to songs that make use of Ecto-Drum (seriously)
